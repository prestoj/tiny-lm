Hello, Claude! This is a project to build some really tiny chat bots. I'm hoping to get a reasonably consistent chatbot in the ~10M parameter range. I have two RTX 3060s with 12GB each. Right now the plan is to train on Project Gutenberg books. I may pivot later to like reddit comments or something. 

Please don't go creating a bunch of unnecessary files, I want to keep things fairly clean. You can make necessary ones.

No shebang lines for python files please.

Thanks a kajillion for helping me out with this project :) I seriously appreciate it.
